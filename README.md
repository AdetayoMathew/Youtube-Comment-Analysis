# Youtube-Comment-Analysis
# Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze and understand the engagement and interaction patterns in the YouTube comment sections of the collaboration between Young Jonn and Davido. The focus is on understanding the volume, timing, and response to comments in order to gauge fan engagement and artist popularity.


# Ideal Solution
The ideal solution would be a dashboard that provides comprehensive insights into the comment activity for this collaboration. This dashboard should include:

Total Number of Comments: To measure overall engagement.
Comment Reply Rate: To assess how interactive the comment section is.
Total Likes on Comments: To understand which comments are resonating most with viewers.
Comment Breakdown by Artist: To see which artist is driving more engagement.
Comment Timing Analysis: To identify the most active times and days for commenting.
Top Commenters: To recognize the most engaged fans.
This data will help the artists, their management, and marketing teams to understand fan engagement levels, optimize the timing of future content releases, and tailor their marketing efforts to maximize impact.

# User Story:
As an Artist Manager or Marketing Team Member, I want to use a dashboard that analyzes YouTube comment data on collaborations.

This dashboard should allow me to identify patterns in fan engagement, such as which artist is driving more comments, the most active commenting times, and the most engaged fans.

With this information, I can make more informed decisions about future collaborations, release timing, and marketing strategies, thereby enhancing fan engagement and maximizing the success of future projects.
